Title: 
Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Sales Data

Description:
In this Jupyter Notebook project, I conduct an exploratory data analysis of Amazon sales data to gain insights into the company's sales trends. The data used in this analysis was collected from Kaggle's Amazon Sales Dataset. The dataset contains information on the product ID, product name, category, discounted and actual prices, discount percentage, rating, number of ratings, product description, user ID, user name, review ID, review title and content, image link, and official website link for each product. I use Python and several Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more, to efficiently analyze and visualize the data. I perform various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for analysis and then explore the data using descriptive statistics, scatter plots, histograms, and other visualization techniques.
Additionally, I extended the analysis to encompass predictive modeling by performing a simple linear regression. This allowed me to build a model that predicts discounted prices. I also incorporated sentiment analysis techniques to extract sentiment information from customer reviews. By analyzing the sentiments expressed in the reviews, I gained a deeper understanding of customer experiences and their impact on product ratings. This analysis sheds light on the overall sentiment landscape and can help identify areas for improvement and optimization.

Data Sources:
I obtained my data from Kaggle's Amazon Sales Dataset, which contains information on the selling products on Amazon. The dataset was created by Karkavel Raja and can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset.

Analysis Methods:
I use Python and several Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, to analyze, visualize, and model the data. We perform various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for analysis and then explore the data using descriptive statistics, scatter plots, histograms, and other visualization techniques. Additionally, I have performed a linear regression analysis to predict the discounted price. I have evaluated the performance of the linear regression model using metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, R-squared value.
In addition to the above analyses, I also have employed sentiment analysis using VADER. VADER is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed to analyze text data sentiments. By leveraging VADER, we can determine customer reviews' sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) in the Amazon sales data. This analysis allows us to understand better customer sentiment and its potential impact on sales and customer satisfaction.
We can gain valuable insights into Amazon sales data by combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, linear regression modeling, and sentiment analysis. These insights can aid in making informed business decisions and uncovering actionable patterns that can drive success.
