Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Sales Data

Description:
In this Jupyter Notebook project, we conduct an exploratory data analysis of Amazon sales data to gain insights into the company's sales trends and customer behavior. The data used in this analysis was collected from the Amazon Top 50 Bestsellers dataset and contains information on the product categories, prices, ratings, and reviews of the best-selling products on Amazon.

Data Sources:
We obtained our data from Kaggle, a platform for data science competitions and community-driven data science projects. The dataset includes information on the top-selling products on Amazon, including books, electronics, toys, and other popular categories.

Analysis Methods:
We use Python and several Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to analyze and visualize the data. We perform various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for analysis and then explore the data using descriptive statistics, scatter plots, histograms, and other visualization techniques.

Results and Conclusions:
Our analysis reveals several interesting findings about Amazon sales trends and customer behavior. For example, we find that electronics and books are the top-selling product categories on Amazon, and that prices and ratings are positively correlated. We also observe that higher-rated products tend to have more reviews, and that the average review rating tends to increase with the number of reviews.

Reproduction Instructions:
To reproduce our analysis, simply download the Jupyter Notebook file and run the code cells in order. Note that you will need to have Python and the required Python libraries installed on your computer.

Acknowledgments:
We would like to thank Kaggle for providing the data used in this analysis. We also acknowledge the Python community for developing and maintaining the open-source libraries that we used in our analysis.
