Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Amazon Sales Data

Description:
In this Jupyter Notebook project, we conduct an exploratory data analysis of Amazon sales data to gain insights into the company's sales trends.The data used in this analysis was collected from Kaggle's Amazon Sales Dataset. The dataset contains information on the product ID, name, category, discounted and actual prices, discount percentage, rating, number of ratings, product description, user ID and name, review ID, review title and content, image link, and official website link for each product. I use Python and several Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to analyze and visualize the data. I perform various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for analysis and then explore the data using descriptive statistics, scatter plots, histograms, and other visualization techniques. 

Data Sources:
I obtained my data from Kaggle's Amazon Sales Dataset, which contains information on the selling products on Amazon. The dataset was created by Karkavel Raja and can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset.

Analysis Methods:
I use Python and several Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn, to analyze, visualize, and model the data. We perform various data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for analysis and then explore the data using descriptive statistics, scatter plots, histograms, and other visualization techniques. Additionally, I have performed a linear regression analysis to predict the discounted price. I have evaluated the performance of the linear regression model using metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, R-squared value.
